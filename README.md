# Communications APIs - Spatial Audio for Web SDK

This sample application allows you to demonstrate how Spatial Audio works. You can run the application on either web or Desktop.

This is what the application looks like side by side with Desktop SDK on the left and Web SDK on the right. Everybody can move the participants on their UI and will get a unique spatial audio scene.

You can also control the spatial audio scene for other participants. When you have the control over the spatial audio scene, you can move the participants around with a simple drag and drop, then the same movement will be applied on the other participants UI.

## Install

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a file called `.env` in you application folder and set your application key and secret that you got from your dolby.io dashboard.

```
CONSUMER_KEY=<YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY_HERE>
CONSUMER_SECRET=<YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE>
```

> *Note:* Your application key must be allowed to use Spatial Audio. [Register](https://go.dolby.io/spatial-audio) for the Closed Beta today.
